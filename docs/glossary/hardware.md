# Hardware - Glossary

## Cooling Solutions  
**Cooling Solutions**: Hardware such as heatsinks or fans used to dissipate heat from the Raspberry Pi and other components, ensuring reliable operation under high loads or in warm environments.

## Enclosures  
**Enclosures**: Protective housings used to shield hardware components such as the Raspberry Pi and CAN transceivers from physical damage, dust, and moisture.

## GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output)  
**GPIO**: Physical pins on the Raspberry Pi used for interfacing with external devices. These pins can be programmed to send or receive digital signals.

## LCD Display  
**LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)**: A type of screen that uses liquid crystals to display data. It is commonly used in instrument clusters for clear, low-power visual outputs.

## Mounting Hardware  
**Mounting Hardware**: Physical components such as brackets, enclosures, or stands used to securely attach the display and Raspberry Pi within the PiRacer vehicle.

## OLED Display  
**OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode)**: A display technology that offers high contrast and brightness. OLEDs are often chosen for their superior visibility and thinner design compared to LCDs.

## PiRacer  
**PiRacer**: A miniature car platform equipped with a CAN bus system, used as the testing and development vehicle for this project.

## Power Supply  
**Power Supply**: The source of electrical power for the system. In automotive contexts, this often refers to the vehicle's 12V electrical system, which is regulated down to 5V for components like the Raspberry Pi.

## Speed Sensor  
**Speed Sensor**: A hardware component that measures the vehicle's speed, typically by detecting the rotation of wheels or the drivetrain. It transmits this data to the Raspberry Pi via the CAN bus.

## Voltage Regulator  
**Voltage Regulator**: A device that converts and stabilizes electrical power. In this project, a 12V to 5V regulator is used to ensure that the Raspberry Pi operates safely within its voltage requirements.

## Wiring Harness  
**Wiring Harness**: A bundle of wires and connectors used to integrate various hardware components, such as the speed sensor, voltage regulator, and Raspberry Pi.
