# Software - Glossary

## CAN Protocol Library  
**CAN Protocol Library**: A software library that abstracts the complexity of communicating with the CAN bus, providing an interface for sending and receiving messages.

## Cross-compilation  
**Cross-compilation**: is a process of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running. The platform difference might be a different OS or a different architecture.

## Data Binding  
**Data Binding**: A technique in software development where the UI elements are automatically updated when the underlying data changes. It is often used in modern GUIs to simplify synchronization between data and views.

## Error Handling  
**Error Handling**: Techniques and practices for managing and responding to errors in the software to ensure stability and reliability. In this project, it includes handling invalid CAN messages or sensor disconnections.

## Event Loop  
**Event Loop**: A control flow structure in Qt that continuously checks for user interactions, system events, or data updates and processes them in real-time.

## JSON Parsing  
**JSON Parsing**: The process of decoding JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data into a format that the application can process. It is used for configuration files or to exchange data between systems.

## Logging  
**Logging**: The practice of recording application activity and system events for debugging and performance monitoring. Logs can help identify issues during development and runtime.

## QML (Qt Modeling Language)  
**QML**: A declarative language in the Qt framework used to design and implement user interfaces with a focus on simplicity and visual richness.

## Signal-Slot Mechanism  
**Signal-Slot Mechanism**: A core concept in the Qt framework that enables communication between different parts of the application. It allows objects to send signals and other objects to respond to them.

## Threading  
**Threading**: A programming technique that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same application. For example, separate threads may handle CAN communication and GUI rendering.

## User Interface (UI) Design  
**UI Design**: The process of creating layouts and interactive elements for the instrument cluster application to ensure usability and visual appeal.
