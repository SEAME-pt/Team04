## 1. Development Environment

The development environment is fully containerized using Docker. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### 1.1. Install Docker

Ensure Docker is installed on your system. For Ubuntu, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

### 1.2. Build the Docker Image

Once Docker is installed, build the image with:

```bash
sudo docker build -t team04_docker .
```

Explanation:

- `-t team04_docker`: This flags the built image with the name team04_docker. You can choose a different name if needed.
- `.`: The dot (.) at the end specifies the current directory as the build context. Docker will use the Dockerfile in this directory to build the image.

### 1.3. Run Docker Container

To run the Docker container with the image and necessary volumes mounted, use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run -t -i \
-v "$(pwd)":/Team04 \
--net=host \
--env="DISPLAY" \
--volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" \
-it team04_docker bash
```

Explanation of flags used:

- `-v "$(pwd)":/Team04`: Mounts the current directory to /Team04 inside the container.
- `--net=host`: Uses the host network for the container, which is helpful for applications that require direct access to the host network (e.g., for GUI applications).
- `--env="DISPLAY"`: Passes the hostâ€™s display environment variable to the container for GUI applications.
- `--volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw"`: Allows access to the X server on the host, which is required for running GUI applications inside the container.
- `-it`: Runs the container interactively with a terminal.

### 1.4. Common Issues

If you encounter an error similar to the following when trying to run Qt applications:

```bash
Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display :1
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "external/qt_linux_x86_64/plugins/platforms" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: eglfs, wayland-egl, vnc, minimal, xcb, vkkhrdisplay, offscreen, wayland, linuxfb, minimalegl.
```

#### Solution: Allow Docker to Access the X Server

To resolve this, run the following command on the host machine to grant Docker containers access to your X server:

```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

This command allows local Docker containers to connect to the X server and use graphical interfaces.

## 2. Tooling

This section outlines the key tools integrated into the development environment.

### 2.1. Bazel

Bazel is a powerful, fast, and extensible build system.

You can run a simple "Hello World" example by executing the following command:

```bash
bazel run //examples/cpp:bin
```

This will build and run the bin target from the examples/cpp directory.

### 2.2. Toolchains And Cross-Compilation

Two toolchains are implemented to build for `x86_64_linux` and `aarch64_linux`. These toolchains define the tool binaries and the corresponding sets of options.

To compile for the `x86_64`, use the following command:

```bash
bazel build <bazel_target> --platforms=//bazel/platforms:x86_64_linux
```

To compile for the `aarch64` (ARM64), use the following command:

```bash
bazel build <bazel_target> --platforms=//bazel/platforms:aarch64_linux
```

#### Examples

```bash
bazel build //examples/cpp:bin --platforms=//bazel/platforms:x86_64_linux
```

#### Toolchain Features

The toolchains also define platform-specific warning options, which are passed via features in the `BUILD` file for each target. Different features can be applied depending on the platform, as shown in the following example:

```starlark
cc_binary(
    name = "bin",
    srcs = ["main.cpp"],
    features = select({
        "//bazel/platforms:aarch64_config": ["warnings_critical_code_gcc"],
        "//conditions:default": ["warnings_critical_code_clang"],
    }),
    deps = [
        ":lib",
    ],
)
```

### Key Points

1. **Toolchain Selection**: Use the `--platforms` flag to select the desired platform-specific toolchain.
2. **Configurable Features**: Customize build features, such as compiler warnings, based on the target platform.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The toolchains enable seamless cross-compilation for both `x86_64` and `aarch64` architectures.

### 2.3. Clang-Tidy

Clang-Tidy is a static analysis tool for C++ code. It helps identify potential issues, enforce coding standards, and suggest improvements to your code. This section describes how to integrate and use Clang-Tidy with your project for both analysis and automatic fixes.

#### 2.3.1. Run Analysis

To run Clang-Tidy analysis install the Clang-Tidy package or run the docker image.

Run Clang-Tidy with the following command:

```bash
clang-tidy <filepath>
```

The checks are define on .clang-tidy file.

#### 2.3.2. Apply Fixes

To automatically apply fixes suggested by Clang-Tidy, follow these steps:

1. Generate compile_commands.json:

    This file contains the necessary compilation information for Clang-Tidy to analyze your project files. Run the following command to generate it:

    ```bash
    bazel run @hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all
    ```

    This ensures that the compile_commands.json file is up-to-date and reflects the latest build settings.

2. Run Clang-Tidy Analysis:

    ```bash
    clang-tidy <filepath> -p ./compile_commands.json
    ```

    Use the following command to find all relevant C++ source files in the project.

    ```bash
    find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cc" -o -name "*.cxx" -o -name "*.hxx" | xargs clang-tidy -p ./compile_commands.json
    ```

3. To automatically apply any fixes, use the following commands:

    ```bash
    clang-tidy <filepath> -fix -fix-errors -p ./compile_commands.json
    ```

   To run for all relevant C++ source files:

    ```bash
    find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cc" -o -name "*.cxx" -o -name "*.hxx" | xargs clang-tidy -fix -fix-errors -p ./compile_commands.json
    ```

### 2.4. Clang-Format

Clang-Format is a tool that automatically formats C++ source code according to a set of predefined or custom style rules. Below are instructions for running Clang-Format analysis and applying automatic fixes to your code locally.

#### 2.4.1. Run Analysis

To check the formatting of your code without making any changes, use the following command. It will run `clang-format` in "dry-run" mode, which simulates formatting and reports any issues without modifying files.

```bash
clang-format <filepath> --dry-run --Werror
```

To run for all relevant C++ source files:

```bash
find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cc" -o -name "*.cxx" -o -name "*.hxx" | xargs clang-format --dry-run --Werror
```

- `find .` recursively searches for C++ source files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- `-name` "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" ... ensures all common C++ file extensions are included.
- `xargs clang-format --dry-run --Werror` applies clang-format to the found files, in "dry-run" mode (no changes are made), and treats any formatting violations as errors (--Werror).

#### 2.4.2. Apply Fixes

To automatically fix the formatting of your code based on the predefined style, you can use the following command. It will rewrite the files in-place according to Clang-Format's rules.

```bash
clang-format <filepath> -fix -fix-errors
```

To run for all relevant C++ source files:

```bash
find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cc" -o -name "*.cxx" -o -name "*.hxx" | xargs clang-format -fix -fix-errors
```

For intended file:

```bash
clang-format -fix -fix-errors
```

### 2.5. Bazel Buildifier

#### 2.5.1. How to Run

`Buildifier` is a tool for formatting Bazel build files (e.g., `BUILD`, `WORKSPACE`). It automatically reformats these files according to a consistent style, improving readability and maintaining consistency across your project.

To run Buildifier execute the following command:

```bash
bazel run //bazel:buildifier
```

### 2.6. Sanitizers

Sanitizers help detect memory errors, undefined behavior, and threading issues during runtime. The following sanitizers are supported:

- **ASAN (AddressSanitizer):** Detects memory errors like buffer overflows and use-after-free.
- **UBSAN (UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer):** Flags undefined behavior in the code.
- **TSAN (ThreadSanitizer):** Identifies data races and threading issues.

#### How to run

To run a target with specific sanitizers using the `--features` options:

```bash
bazel run <bazel_target> --features=<sanitizer>
```

#### Examples

To enable ASAN and UBSAN:

```bash
bazel run //examples/cpp:bin --features=asan --features=ubsan
```

To enable TSAN:

```bash
bazel run //examples/cpp:bin --features=tsan
```

**Note**: TSAN needs to run separatly from ASAN because `-fsanitize=address` is incompatible with `-fsanitize=thread`.
